# Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure - Landing zones on Terraform - Azure Kubernetes Services

Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure provides you with guidance and best practices to adopt Azure.

A landing zone is a segment of a cloud environment, that has been preprovisioned through code, and is dedicated to the support of one or more workloads. Landing zones provide access to foundational tools and controls to establish a compliant place to innovate and build new workloads in the cloud, or to migrate existing workloads to the cloud. Landing zones use defined sets of cloud services and best practices to set you up for success.

You can find the core Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure - Terraform landing zones here: [CAF landing zones](https://github.com/Azure/caf-terraform-landingzones/)

## Goals
